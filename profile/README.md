# 🌳 Yggdrasil-Labs

> Connecting realms of technology — from roots to branches.

**Yggdrasil-Labs** is a multi-project ecosystem inspired by the World Tree from Norse mythology.  
We build unified, modular foundations for modern software — across **frontend**, **backend**, **mobile**, and **AI** domains.

---

### 🧩 Vision
To create a self-sustaining, extensible development ecosystem —  
where each branch represents a distinct yet connected realm of innovation.

---

### 🏗️ Structure

| Realm | Repository | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 📚 **Docs** | [`docs`](https://github.com/Yggdrasil-Labs/docs) | Unified documentation & architecture blueprints |

---

### ⚙️ Shared Standards
- Centralized **CI/CD workflows** under this `.github` repository  
- Unified **code style, testing, and versioning** guidelines  
- Modular architecture with **shared base dependencies**

---

### 🌌 Philosophy
> _“Yggdrasil connects all worlds — so should great software.”_

Every project under this organization grows from a shared root,  
yet extends outward freely — scalable, consistent, and alive.
